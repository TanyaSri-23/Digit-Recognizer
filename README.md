# Digit-Recognizer
Handwritten digits(from kaggle dataset) have been classified using a Convolutional Neural Network and the code follows an object oriented approch which has been implemented using Pytorch. The model gives 98.42% accuracy on training dataset, 97.93% on validation datset and 97.85% on training datset.
